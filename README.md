# Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of Row Health’s marketing campaigns to generate insights and provide recommendations for allocating budgets across future campaign categories.

Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving over thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates.

The company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to increase the number of customer signups, and 2) to raise awareness of Row Health’s brand across the country.

# Insights Deep-Dive

Across categories, Health for All and Benefit Updates performed nearly 3-4x better than the average CTR at 26% and 22%, respectively. Within the two categories with high CTR, product promotion-based campaigns had relatively low CTR (0% and 7%).

Across campaign categories, Health for All campaigns had the best-performing signup rate (2.1%) and the second-highest number of signups (3.5K). This high signup rate is due to the Health Awareness campaign type, which had by far the highest signup rate across all campaign types (2.78%). Interestingly, the category with the highest number of signups - #HealthyLiving - had a comparably low signup rate at 0.27%.
